    <img id="prof" src="profile.jpg">
    <p>my name is israel abramovitch and from early days i used to spend lot of times with computers. mainly
        playing games... <br>   
        later i had an experience with some basic programming in several platforms and languages:
        visual basic, pascal, texas instruments graphical calculator with programming (sort of basic i think) and arduino. <br>
        as a child i had a dream to work in the computer industry but later on it changed to agriculture. <br>
        during my 13 years in my current job i've dealt with several industrial machines with lots of logic problems that remind me coding problems <br>
        every sensor is like an "if" and every timer is like a loop 
        in the above profile picture i've expressed my despair to the suppliers of a machine that i worked on for two months in order to deal with tons of production faults and also programming faults <br> 
    אני אוהב לרכב על אופניים ולהרים משקולות
